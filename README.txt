Plugin to Atlassian Confluence with the initial goal of culling prior attachment
versions by use of a scheduled job. It is first intended to get a job working
to cull attachments based on age, though other configurable attributes may be
added later.

I have called this the attachment tools plugin as I may decide at a later date
to add other useful tools for attachments in here.
